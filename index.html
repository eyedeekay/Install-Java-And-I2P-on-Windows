<p>Getting I2P installed and configured on Windows has at times been a process which left many of our potential users confused. As power-users and developers, this issue is sometimes invisible to us. So to get a better impression of what the experience is for a new I2P user, I installed an unfamiliar OS on an old laptop and undertook the install process, from start to finish.</p>
<p>This is deliberately the most detailed version of this guide I could justify as in-scope, some steps might be redundant on computers that have already been in use for some time.</p>
<h2 id="what-an-unfamiliar-os-how-is-that-useful">What? An unfamiliar OS? How is that useful?</h2>
<p>Relax, it’s Windows.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-are-we-going-to-do-here">So what are we going to do here?</h2>
<p>We’re going to finish four tasks. We are going to:</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="part-one-install-java">Part One: Install Java</h3>
<p>If you already have java installed, you may <a href="#part-two-install-i2p">Skip This Step</a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I2P requires Java to run, if you don’t have Java installed, you will get an error that looks like this: <img src="nojava.png" alt="Uh oh, no Java yet" /></li>
<li>We appreciate that you have a wide range of choices in Java software, but the Oracle Java software is the easiest to install and use with I2P on Windows. Please use this version. <img src="oraclejava.png" alt="You need Oracle Java for Windows" /></li>
<li>Download it from here: <img src="getjava.png" alt="So download it" /></li>
<li>Double-click the Java Installer you just downloaded. Don’t set a custom path, just use the default one. <img src="startjava.png" alt="Start installing Java" /></li>
<li>Java will show you some information about what it is and where it runs while you wait for it to finish installing. <img src="installjava.png" alt="Step one" /></li>
<li>When you see this, Java is almost installed. <img src="installjava2.png" alt="Step two" /></li>
<li>Java is now installed! <img src="installedjava.png" alt="You’re done!" /></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="part-two-install-i2p">Part Two: Install I2P</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download I2P from <a href="https://geti2p.net" class="uri">https://geti2p.net</a>. <img src="geti2p.png" alt="Download I2P" /></li>
<li>I2P is available in many languages. Select one that is familiar to you. <img src="i2plang.png" alt="Select your Language" /></li>
<li>On the first screen, we introduce our software. <img src="i2pnext.png" alt="Introduction" /></li>
<li>I2P is mostly public domain software, with permissive licenses and a small amount of GPL2’ed Free Software. <img src="i2plicense.png" alt="Accept the License Agreement(or mostly lack thereof)" /></li>
<li>You should probably leave I2P installed at the default path, as it is easiest to work with this way. <img src="i2ppath.png" alt="Select the path to install to" /></li>
<li>Check “Install Windows Service” to run I2P automatically on your computer. <img src="installbase.png" alt="Select Components" /></li>
<li>I2P will copy it’s files into the install location. <img src="installrun.png" alt="Wait a moment" /></li>
<li>I2P is now installed! <img src="installed.png" alt="Finish it up" /></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="part-three-install-a-real-browserfirefox">Part Three: Install a Real Browser(Firefox)</h3>
<p>If you already have Firefox installed, you may <a href="#part-four-configure-i2p-bandwidth">Skip This Step</a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get Firefox from <a href="https://mozilla.org">htps://mozilla.org</a> <img src="firefox.png" alt="Get Firefox" /></li>
<li>Run the installer. <img src="firefox-installer.png" alt="Run the installer" /></li>
<li>Download the Firefox Profile Bundle from the I2P Web Site. <img src="profile.png" alt="Grab the Firefox Profile" /></li>
<li>Select the language you want to use for the install process. <img src="profilelang.png" alt="Select your language" /></li>
<li>The Profile Bundle incorporates lots of external software, so it has a detailed license document. <img src="profilelicense.png" alt="Accpt the License Agreement" /></li>
<li>You now have a browser ready for I2P! <img src="profiledone.png" alt="Now your browser is configured" /></li>
</ol>
